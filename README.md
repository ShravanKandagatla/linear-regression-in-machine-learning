Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables. It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting. Different regression models differ based on – the kind of relationship between dependent and independent variables they are considering, and the number of independent variables getting used. There are many names for a regression’s dependent variable.  It may be called an outcome variable, criterion variable, endogenous variable, or regressand.  The independent variables can be called exogenous variables, predictor variables, or regressors.

Linear regression is used in many different fields, including finance, economics, and psychology, to understand and predict the behavior of a particular variable. For example, in finance, linear regression might be used to understand the relationship between a company’s stock price and its earnings, or to predict the future value of a currency based on its past performance.
